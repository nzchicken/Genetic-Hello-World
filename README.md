# Genetic Hello World

A slightly less simple attempt at genetic programming. Forked from Sacert on github. Improvements:

- Uses webpack and babel to do builds
- Controls on generation generation
- Controllable characters for generation (doesn't use ASCII 0 - 255)
- Different types of mutations
- Changed mating algorithm
- Output tables every x generations
- Show top genes each x generation


## Build

    yarn install
    yarn run start
